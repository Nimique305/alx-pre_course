My first readme

This is my first git readme, where I enter and learn more about the world of coding and software engineering. I will be taking this journey over a span of a year and sharpening my coding skills moving forward. My plan is to be fully skilled in software engineering and be able to influence change with code. I will develop code to present holistically in my readme in due time.
